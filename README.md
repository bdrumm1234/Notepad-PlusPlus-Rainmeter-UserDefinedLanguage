# Rainmeter - Notepad++ User Defined Language
This is a user defined language that was created prior to me for Rainmeter, but was modified to fit my needs. I also performed some fixes to the Language Definition.


Import this XML File into your Languages for Notepad++. Look under

    Language Menu -> Define your language... -> Import

    Select [Rainmeter4.3.0] in the Language Drop Down Menu after importing and you are set!
